>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>          as modifying the License.
>
>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

>      the conditions stated in this License.
>
>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
>
>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
